# Telco_ Project
by cristian ibarra 

# Project Goals:

Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?

Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.

Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken, why and what was the outcome?

# Project steps:

Step 1: Understanding the Problem.

Step 2: Data Extraction.

Step 3: Data Cleaning.

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis.

Step 5: Feature Selection.

Step 6: Testing the Models.

Step 7: Deploying the Model.

# Hypotheses:
Ho1 -> There is no association between churn and a customer gender optic Ha1 -> There is an association between churn and a customer gender

Ho2 -> There is no association between churn and a customer having multiple lines Ha2 -> There is an association between churn and a customer having multiple lines

HoFinal ->

# Goal:
Churn â€” Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No)
